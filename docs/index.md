# Overview of the project 

This code was developed by Jules Colas during his PhD thesis.
The PhD manuscript can be found [here](https://acoustique.ec-lyon.fr/publi/colas_thesis.pdf)
The different tools that were used in his PhD thesis are regrouped here.

It contains: 

- A Fortran code used to perform Parabolic equation simulation. 
- A Fortran LES code used to compute the atmospheric flow around a wind farm.
- A Python code used to compute the source power emitted by each segment of a wind turbine blade considering realistic inflow condition.
- Post and Pre processing tools used to chain this different code in order to perform a full acoustic wind farm simulation.
